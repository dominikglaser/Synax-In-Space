# Custom Music Folder

Upload your custom music files here to replace the procedural music system.

## Folder Structure

- **menu/** - Music for the main menu screen
- **gameplay/** - Music for the gameplay loop
- **victory/** - Music for the victory/win screen
- **gameover/** - Music for the game over screen
- **story/** - Music for the story/intro screen

## Supported Formats

- MP3 (.mp3)
- OGG (.ogg)
- WAV (.wav)

## Usage

Place your music files in the appropriate folder. The game will automatically use them if they're available, otherwise it will fall back to the procedural music system.

## File Naming

You can use any filename. The game will load the first audio file found in each folder.
